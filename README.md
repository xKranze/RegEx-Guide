# RegEx Guide

## Description 
  This will be a RegEx guide for me and anyone else that would like to see notes and description of about RegEx.

  What is a RegEx? A regex, which is short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input.
